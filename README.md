# Spotify-Music-Global-Analysis
This project explores global music trends on Spotify using a curated dataset of 8,579 tracks.
The analysis focuses on artist popularity, genre performance, historical trends, and the relationship between an artist’s audience size and track popularity.
The goal of the project is to demonstrate data cleaning, exploratory analysis, dashboard design, and insight generation using Excel as primary tool.

# Key Objectives

Analyze global trends in track popularity over time
Identify top-performing artists and genres
Compare explicit vs clean content performance
Explore the relationship between artist followers and track popularity
Build a clear, interactive dashboard for business-style insights

# Key Insights

**Top Artists**
Taylor Swift leads by a significant margin in total followers, highlighting the strong impact of a loyal fan base.
Other global artists (Ed Sheeran, Billie Eilish, The Weeknd) show comparable popularity levels but remain behind the top performer.

**Popularity Trends Over Time**

Track popularity increased steadily from the 1960s to the late 1990s.
From the 2000s onward, popularity stabilizes, suggesting a more saturated and competitive music market.
Decade-based filtering reveals how musical trends evolve across generations.

**Explicit vs Clean Content**

28% of tracks are marked as explicit, while 72% are clean.
There is no strong negative impact of explicit labeling on popularity, indicating broad listener acceptance.

**Genre Performance**

Genres such as latin alternative, screamo, and rock and roll show higher average popularity.
Several niche or alternative genres outperform expectations, suggesting strong, dedicated listener bases.

**Correlation: Followers vs Track Popularity**

A moderate positive correlation exists between artist followers and track popularity.
Artists with larger audiences tend to release more popular tracks, but high popularity is still achievable for less-followed artists.
This indicates that fan base size increases probability of success, not a guarantee.

**Business Interpretation**

Artist audience size matters, but content quality and genre relevance remain crucial.
Historical popularity trends can support nostalgia-based playlists and marketing campaigns.
Genre-level insights can help streaming platforms optimize curated playlists.
Explicit content does not significantly reduce listener engagement, providing flexibility in content strategy.
